All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7] - 2023-01-08

## Added

- daemon mode: push to cachix while building

- `cachix import`: allow importing S3 binary caches into Cachix

## Fixed

- Ignore sigPIPE exception

- Fix InvalidPath for case insensitive conflicts on macOS

- Handle common store path errors to print a human readable exception

- Pretty Print C+ exceptions

- Deploy: don't throw errors when bootstrapping fails

- Retry only HTTP exceptions, failing on fatal exceptions (like auth access)

## [1.6.1] - 2023-09-25

## Fixed

- deploy: Correctly format `cachix deploy agent` exception messages

- deploy: use high-level activate script for Darwin

- deploy: Support darwin-version.json

- #547: Filter invalid paths when watching the store

- Filter out existing upstream paths when using watch-exec

- Retrying is now printed as stderr, which is important for watch-exec automation

- Set the file system encoding to utf8 to fix some hash mismatch errors

## Added

- Implement a daemon for pushing store paths (more on this feature later on blog.cachix.org)

## [1.6] - 2023-06-27

## Added

- `cachix remove MYCACHE`: reverses `cachix use MYCACHE`.

## Changed

- `cachix push` now displays a progress bar and summary before pushing.

## [1.5] - 2023-05-17

### Added

- `cachix pin` - See https://docs.cachix.org/pins

### Fixed

- Reverted "Rewrite C++ bits to Haskell"
  
  This reverts 15 commits related towards getting Cachix to
  built statically without C++ code in Nix.
  
  Since it's not possible to interact with Nix sqlite directly
  in a reliable manner, we'll go the route of autogenerating C++
  binding without Template Haskell, at some point.
  
## [1.4.2] - 2023-04-05

### Fixed

- Fix watch-* command with the new Store implementation by openining a new connection each time.

## [1.4.1] - 2023-03-31

### Fixed

- Open Nix database in read-only mode instead of immutable.

## [1.4] - 2023-03-26

### Changed

- Rewrote C++ bindings to Nix in Haskell, reducing the closure and making it easy to
statically compile Cachix.

## [1.3.3] - 2023-03-18

### Fixed

- Fix watch-exec exiting too soon.

## [1.3.2] - 2023-03-17

### Fixed

- Fix build on GHC 9.4

## [1.3.1] - 2023-03-09

### Fixed

- Signal handling in watch-exec & watch-store commands.

## [1.3] - 2023-03-06

### Added

- Upload nars using multiple parts, improving bandwidth speed and parallelization.

### Changed

- Bump defaults jobs to 8.
- Improve 401 erros by showing the body of backend response.
- Deploy: improve agent startup and shutdown.

### Fixed

- Unblock interrupt signal on darwin (possibly also Linux).
- Deploy: wait for the logs to finish when activating.

## [1.2] - 2023-01-06

### Added

- NARs are now streamed without invoking an external process, so if
you have a lot of small files, there should be some significant performance improvements

- `cachix deploy activate` now by default waits for the agents to be deployed, displays the logs and exists if any deployments fail.
  If you'd like to keep the old behaviour pass `--async` flag.

### Changed

- We no longer pin Nix to speed up version bumps of Nix

### Fixed

- A number of improvements to stability of the websocket connection used in cachix deploy.

- Fixed a regression in `cachix deploy activate`, requiring `--agent` flag that should be optional.

- Fixed a C++ crash that would sometimes happen on exceptions in rare conditions.

## [1.1] - 2022-12-16

### Added 

- Use ZSTD compresion method by default and allow overriding it via `--compression-method` back to XZ. You can also change the default permanently on your binary cache settings page.

- Cachix Deploy got a complete rewrite with correctness in mind and reliablity.

- Cachix Deploy agent now supports --bootstrap that awaits a new agent to spawn and then shuts down.

- Cachix Deploy now supports [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/pull/3380)

- Generated NixOS module now uses the naming of Nix settings as introduced in NixOS 22.05.

### Added 

- `cachix config`: allow setting hostname

## [1.0.0] - 2022-09-06

- Cachix Deploy: disable negative narinfo caching

## [0.8.1] - 2022-07-26

- Cachix Deploy: retry exceptions every 1s instead of exponentially 

### Fixed

## [0.8.0] - 2022-07-10

### Fixed

- Cachix Deploy: properly fix disconnection issues
- Cachix Deploy: deployments are now a separate process so cachix agent can be upgraded at any time

### Changed

- Watching nix store doesn't push .drv files anymore
- `cachix push -w` has been moved to `cachix watch-store`
- `cachix create` has been removed
- Retries now take a multiple of seconds instead of multiple of 100ms

### Added

- watch-exec allows to run a command and push all new store paths added meanwhile
- GHC 8.10 support

### Fixed

- Watching /nix/store now uses queue to bulk query what is missing in binarycache and
  a queue for pushing

## [0.5.1] - 2020-11-09

### Fixed

- Regression: use auth token when using signing key with private caches 
- Configure netrc even if cachix config doesn't exist

## [0.5.0] - 2020-11-06

### Added

- Allow specifying output directory to write nix.conf and netrc files. 
- Allow pushing without a Signing key using only auth token
- Allow setting auth token via `$CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN` shell variable

  * #290: Explain what is going on when there's no signing key

  * #262: improve instructions when on NixOS and the user is untrusted


## [0.3.7] - 2020-03-12

### Added

- Allow specifying number of parallel jobs when pushing: cachix push mycache -j8

### Changed

- Print stderr during streaming of nars    

### Fixed

- Use max up to 8 cores to prevent performance issues
  on machines with lots of cores

- Get deriver and references from C++ structures rather
  then shelling out (slight performance improvement)

- #251: Assert nar hash before creating narinfo
    
  Fixes rare but annoying bug of "bad nar archive" from Nix.
  Never managed to reproduce. One theory is that the path disappears as
  its deleted by GC or nix-store --delete.

- Print correct path when passing --nixos-folder and encountering an error


## [0.3.6] - 2020-02-22

### Fixed

- #275: support LTS-13.x and GHC 8.2.2

### Added

- #265: print store path size before compressing/pushing

### Fixed

- #258: don't swallow exceptions while --watch-store
- NixOS: instruct to use sudo

## [0.3.4] - 2019-10-01

### Fixed

- #240: push: prefer store paths as command arguments over stdin 

  Some programming languages like go and nodejs always open
  stdin pipe, which confuses cachix to think there's stdin content.
  
  Sadly checking stdin for contents is tricky since we get
  into the whole buffering mess.

- #233: push: if multiple caches exist, pick the latest signing key
